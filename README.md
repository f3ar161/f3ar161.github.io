# GP - Project v4

Within the video game industry, a suite of services has emerged that facilitate the acquisition of data via APIs. To support this, development portals are provided by companies, offering a shared space where external developers can access and leverage these platforms. A prime example of this is Riot Games and its platform, https://developer.riotgames.com/, which grants users access to data from all their games through custom-built applications.

However, recent years have highlighted a pressing need for automation in the application creation process to mitigate the platform's misuse, namely, the unrestricted proliferation of applications. Such practices have a detrimental impact on the user experience of both players and developers alike.

This project proposes an automated workflow that involves analyzing the log data associated with each application. By scrutinizing this information, we aim to discriminate between legitimate applications and spam, thereby focusing our efforts on a refined analysis.
